# WWII
Fully featured WWII pygame, written 100% in python.


**Features:**


* 5 customizable loadouts, complete with 20 default guns and 9 perks to choose from

* 5 default maps

* Gun and map creators

* 1v1 online multiplayer

* Offline competition against AI

* Rank system. Level up to unlock new guns, perks, and feautures

* Gun sounds, as well as background sound/music



**Controls:**

* Menus: left click to choose options

* Gun builder (gun stat creator): drag sliders to change stats

* Gun builder (model creator) and map builder: controls listed in game. However, you can also use WASD and IJKL for faster creation

* In game: mouse to turn, left click to move, right click to shoot, and right shift to pause

* Always: escape/x button to quit
 


**Please Note:**

* If you want to play online on something other than lan, you have to port forward everything coming in at port 5006 to port 5006. The client then must use your public (not private!!) IP address to connect.


* This is built for python 2.7, but is mostly compatible with python 3 (with the most notable exception being issues with the online mode I'm too lazy to fix).


* If you are lazy like me and don't want/have the time to rank up to level 25 to unlock everything, there is a file located in WWII\Data called max\_rank.py. Run the file to instantly get rank 25.
